# Tableau_Dashboard
**I have created this dashboard using AIRBNB dataset.**<br><br>
In this dataset I got 3 excel files Listing, Calendar, Review. Under this section I used inner join for Listing and Calendar table with listing ID.<br><br>
You can analyse the average price in different location(ZIPCODE) of Washington and average price for the different number of bedrooms and company revenue during a year in different days etc.<br><br>
